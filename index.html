Hello World.

Djikstra's shortest path implementation in C++.

A key data structure used in Djikstra shortest path algorithm is the priority queue.
A minimal "vanilla" min priority queue has the following api:

void push (object, priority).
This adds an object with the associated priority into the priority queue.

object pop ()
This removes the object with lowest priority from the queue and returns it.

However, this api is insufficient for the priority queue we require for our shortest path algorithm.
We need the following additional functions:
1. The pop function, in addition to returning the object with minimum priority, must also return the priority value itself.
This is because in the Djikstra's shortest path algorithm, that priority is the length of the shortest path to the node being popped.
This value is used to modify the priorities of its neighbouring nodes in the queue.
One way to solve this without changing the api is to embed the priority into the object being pushed or popped itself, which in this case
is a node. The node and its priority could be combined into a single class, say node_with_prio. This might have a method prio () that returns the priority of the node.

2. An additional method, decrease_priority (node, prio) needs to be implemented. The 'node' argument is a handle to an object in the queue. One possibility is that
nodes are just addressed as integers starting from 0 and 'node' is just the value of the integer. How do we implement the node to queue element mapping?


Is it possible to keep the design of the priority queue completely general? i.e. can we create a priority queue that can store arbitrary objects with integer priorities? Also,
is it possible to do that while keeping the api as close to the minimal api described? Clearly, one addition in the form of decrease_priority function will have to be made
to the minimal api. Even so, what would be a general way of accessing elements inside the queue?
The decrease_priority method described above is a not so general method since it depends on each queue element (nodes in our case) being addressable using an integer. This
may not be the case always. A better way would be to access each element via some sort of reference.
